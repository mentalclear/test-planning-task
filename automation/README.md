# Automation

## Contents here:

1. **router.test.js** pseudocode Javascript based tests for Router test cases described in the `/docs/TestCases/RouterTestCases.md`

2. One of the requirements asked for test results and reporting. Since I'm not implementing the actual automation framework here, it's a bit cumbersome to demo. But, if I was building one - I would use [mochawesome package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome), I haven't worked with this one before. But it shouldn't be hard to add to a project.
